	<h1>The <u>:hover</u> Pseudo-class</h1>
	<p>
		Hover is one of the many pseudo-classes. For example you can change, you can control the styling of an element
	        when the mouse hovers over it, when it is clicked and when it was previously clicked.The :hover CSS pseudo-class
	        matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it.
	        It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Styles defined by the :active pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class
	        (:link, :visited, or :active) that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the 
		:hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order:
	        :link   :visited   :hover   :active.
	</p>
	<h3>Basic Example:</h3>
	<p>
		<b>HTML</b>
		<a class="hover" href="#">Try hovering over this link.</a>
		<b>CSS</b>
		a {
  			background-color: powderblue;
  			transition: background-color .5s;
		  }

		a:hover {
  			background-color: gold;
			}
	</p>
	<br>

	<h1>The <u>:visited</u> Pseudo-class</h1>
	<p>
		The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons,
	        the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited.Styles defined by the :visited 
		pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class (:link, :hover, or :active)
	        that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the :visited rule after the :link
	        rule but before the :hover and :active rules, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link   :visited   :hover   
		:active.
	</p>
	<h3>Basic Example:</h3>
	<p>
		Properties that would otherwise have no color or be transparent cannot be modified with :visited. Of the 
		properties that can be set with this pseudo-class, your browser probably has a default value for color and
	        column-rule-color only. Thus, if you want to modify the other properties, you'll need to give them a base
	        value outside the :visited selector.

		<b>HTML</b>
			<a href="#test-visited-link">Have you visited this link yet?</a><br>
			<a href="">You've already visited this link.</a>
		<b>CSS</b>
			a {
  				/* Specify non-transparent defaults to certain properties,
     				allowing them to be styled with the :visited state */
  				background-color: white;
  				border: 1px solid white;
			  }

			a:visited {
  				background-color: yellow;
  				border-color: hotpink;
  				color: hotpink;
				  }
