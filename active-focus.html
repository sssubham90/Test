	<h1>The <u>:focus</u> and <u>:active</u> Pseudo-Classes</h1>
	<p>
		An element needs to be able to focus if a user is going to interact with it;
		typically such elements are form controls and links.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		When an element gain focus,it tends to have a slightly different appearance,and the :focus pseudo-
		class allows you to associate extra rules with an element when it gains focus.Meanwhile the :active
		pseudo-class allows you to associate further styles with elements when they are activated-such as
		when a user clicks a link.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Here is an example of a rule that will add a red border to any <input> element that gains focus:
		<b>input:focus{outline:#ff0000 thick solid;}</b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Unfortunately,the <i>:focus</i> pseudo-class does not work in IE7 (or Firefox 2 on a Mac),although a text
		input box would lookm like with this style when it gain focus in Firefox on a PC.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		As you can probably imagine, this could offer users help in knowing which item they should currently be filling
		in as they work their way through a form.
