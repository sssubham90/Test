TABLE
</H1>
<P>
A table is a structured set of data made up of of rows and columns (tabular data).
 A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, 
 for example a person and their age, or a day or the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
HTML tables should be used for tabular data — this is what they are designed for.
 Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages
 , e.g. one row to contain the header, one row to contain the content columns,
 one row to contain the footer, etc.

DIMENSIONS

<P>
The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width can be set to auto (this is default. Means that the browser calculates the height and width), 
or be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block.

 BACKGROUND

 <P>
 The background tag in html lets us control the background image we want in our html page.
 We can use any background image in html by using the background tag.
 We simply have to provide the source location of the image in our declaration of the background tag.

 body background="URL"

<h4>
MARGIN
</H4>
<P>
With one value, the margin property can be used to specify a uniform margin around a box. With two, three, or four values, sides can be specified independently.

Possible Values

Value	Note	Example
[length]		10px
[percentage]	Calculated as a percentage of the containing box’s width.	25%.


margin is a shorthand property. Margins can be set on sides independently with margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.

margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; is the same as margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 40px;
